<section> put bootstrap divs inside </section>

The section element is not a generic container element. When an element is needed for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are encouraged to use the div element instead. A general rule is that the section element is appropriate only if the element's contents would be listed explicitly in the document's outline.

Chuck it in section so can style the bits as needed

<section/div id="unq_id" class="class_name" > <close>

ids are unique can be used to target that particular element to style it etc

classes are not unique i.e. container, circle etc can be applied to > 1 element

targeting them in css

 #unq_id{
 }

 .class_name{
 }

 The <span> tag is used to group inline-elements in a document.

 The <span> tag provides no visual change by itself.
